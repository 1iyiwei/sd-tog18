We'd like to fill up a high dimensional space with blue noise points, not too close together, not too far apart.

One of the only scalable algorithms is to use rejection sampling in a local neighborhood.
But are there any big gaps? And do they get worse with increasing dimension?

Our new Spoke darts algorithm uses line samples to provide provable guarantees that any gaps are probably small.

See it in action!
