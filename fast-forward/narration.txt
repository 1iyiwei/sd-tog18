We'd like to fill up a high dimensional space with blue noise points, 
not too close together, 
not too far apart.

One of the only scalable algorithms in high-d is rejection sampling in a local neighborhood,
but can leave big gaps, especially in high-d.

Our new Spoke darts algorithm uses line sampling.
It is just as fast,
And provides a guarantees that any gaps are probably small,
in every dimension.

See it in action!
