To fill up a high dimensional space with blue noise points, one of the only scalable algorithms is to use rejection sampling in a local neighborhood.
However, that can leave you with ... big ... gaps (add elephant noise!)
Our new Spoke darts algorithm uses line samples to provide provable guarantees that any gaps are probably small.
