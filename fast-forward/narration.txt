We'd like to fill up a high dimensional space with blue noise points, 
not too close, 
not too far.

One of the only scalable algorithms in high-d is rejection sampling in a local neighborhood,
but it can leave big gaps, especially in high-d.

Our new Spoke darts algorithm uses line sampling.
It is just as fast,
And provides a guarantees that any gaps are probably small.

We have motion planning, rendering, geometry, and optimization apps.

[say something about our method as you did, but shorter.]

Applications of our method include motion planning, rendering, geometry, and optimization.
