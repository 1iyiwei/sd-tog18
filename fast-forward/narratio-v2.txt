We'd like to fill space with blue noise points, without gaps.

In high dimensions, one of the only scalable methods uses rejection sampling in a local neighborhood,
but can leave big gaps.

Spoke darts uses line samples,
and guarantees gaps are probably small,
regardless of dimension.

Apps are motion planning, rendering, geometry, and optimization
