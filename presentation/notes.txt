outline:


points:

what:
high d blue noise, scalable algorithm with guaranteed saturation, a few applications but mainly its about the algorithm.applications - what they are <rep image>
  8d rendering, unclear what difference saturation makes, we match other's quality
  8d Delaunay graph, used by global opt
  100d global optimization - advancing front adaptive search pattern is paramount, 
  23d motion planning, (non-uniform size rectangle vs. low discrepancy sequence), illustrate where sampling comes in.
high-d - why can't we do it the same as in low-d? 
  Simple mps guarantees saturation but doesn't scale.
  Bridson 2007, prior SIGGRAPH algorithm scales, but doesn't guarantee saturation.
    point sampling in local annular region
    unknown saturation? volume fraction within annulus, but large region outside all annuli?
line-sampling
  illustrate algorithm
  show outline of saturation proof, without many equations... 
  math formula for guarantee - what can be chosen, picked
output quality
  runtime, save about one dimension
  saturation in practice similar?
  narrowing beta as d increases

  line vs point vs MPS

  output distribution sharp discontinuity
    try non-uniform by length, problem of any sharp rule, local distribution -> discontinuity global
    doing better, mimic two radii sampling with using two lines

runtime
 O(d n^2) for large d, can speed up the n^2 factor in low d with k-d trees, other search system

applications - how they work


important figures:

m  = \left\lceil  {(-\ln{\epsilon})} (\beta^*-1)^{1-d} \right\rceil
\Leftrightarrow
\beta^* = 1 + \left(  \frac{-\ln{\epsilon}}{m} \right)^{1/(d-1)}
